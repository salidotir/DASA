# DASA (Data Analysis for Smart Agriculture Project)

### Abstract
This repository contains the final project for the course "Data Analysis for Smart Agriculture" at Polimi, completed by [our team](). The objective of this project is to perform preprocessing tasks on a real dataset from a company in the smart agriculture sector and conduct various analyses to provide valuable insights and recommendations for enhancing the company's revenue and improving the quality of their products or services.

The dataset utilized in this project spans the past three years and originates from a dairy company located in the north of Italy. Due to privacy constraints, we are unable to disclose the company's name or share the dataset provided to us. However, the outcomes of our analysis are documented in this repository.

### Dataset Structure
Initially, the dataset was disorganized and fragmented. As part of the preprocessing stage, we performed data cleaning and merged different datasets to create a unified dataset suitable for our analysis.

### Data Analysis Tasks
A series of data analysis tasks were conducted on the dataset, the details of which are outlined in the project report.

### Results
The results are available in this [pdf file](https://github.com/salidotir/DASA/blob/main/DASA%20Project%20Final%20Presentation.pdf).
